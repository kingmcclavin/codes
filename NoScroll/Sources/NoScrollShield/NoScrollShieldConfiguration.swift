/// The screen a user hits when they open the real Instagram while shielded.
///
/// This is the most-seen screen in the product and it is doing persuasion work,
/// not just blocking: the user is here because a habit fired. Two deliberate
/// choices:
///
///  1. The primary button leads INTO NoScroll rather than just dismissing.
///     A shield that only says "no" trains people to fight it; one that offers
///     the calm version of the same thing redirects the impulse.
///  2. No shame, no streak-loss language, no counters. The research on the app
///     we are cloning shows its loudest complaints cluster around feeling
///     manipulated. Judgemental copy here is what earns that.
///
/// Requires the `com.apple.developer.family-controls` entitlement on THIS target
/// as well as the host app.
